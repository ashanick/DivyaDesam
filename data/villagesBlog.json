Both my grandmother hail from Mannargudi, not to mention the that every single person I meet says, yes, I know someone from Mannargudi. It is a beautiful small town, with a lovely central water tank, surrounded by lush fields. At my maternal great grandmother's home, there is a small room with a window that faces Haridra Nadi. All her daughters gave birth in this room, which I believe reminded them of Shimla. In addition, patti locked all her jewels and valuables in a matka in this room.",

He was still sharp as a tack, and excited to take us through his 280-year old home and through a small stairwell which led to a terrace. From here we could see the backyard and the many trees that almost seem to have been there forever.",
